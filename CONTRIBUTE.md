# How to Contribute

If you find a typo or other copy error, please feel free to open an issue and submit a pull request.

## Submitting Additional Challenges

Additional challenges are gladly accepted via *pull request*.  We ask that you follow the established repository structure and following guidelines:

1. Create a dedicated subdirectory for each new challenge.
1. Describe the challenge in a `README.md` using [Markdown syntax](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
1. Place related supplemental files in the new challenge directory (as an example, see `sowpods.txt` in the `03-scrabble-words` challenge).
1. Update `README.md` at the root of this repo, adding an entry in the list of challenges and a link to the new challenge directory.


## Submitting a Solution to a Challenge

These challenges are intended to be just that: *challenges* that push the programmer to be resourceful in finding a solution with little guidance.

However, if you have a solution you *feel compelled* to share, you may submit a pull request for consideration.  Your solution should be organized under a subdirectory of the challenge: `<challenge>/solutions/<userame>`.  See the [solution to sorting warmup](https://github.com/PDXPythonPirates/code-challenges/blob/master/00-sorting/solutions/imattman/) as an example.
