# Challenge: Check Current Weather

Write a program that queries the current weather from the [Open Weather Map API][openwm].

> Note: you will need to sign up for a free account to obtain an **API key**.

Your program should accept 2 different inputs:
- Query the API by **zip code** when the user supplies numeric input.
- Otherwise query the API by city name using the supplied input.

As an added challenge how might you recognize and process a request based on supplied latitude and longitude values?
